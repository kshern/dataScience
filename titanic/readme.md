<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.</p>
<p>On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.</p>
<p>While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.</p>
<p>In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).</p>

<h2>What Data Will I Use in This Competition?</h2>
<p>In this competition, you‚Äôll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled <code>train.csv</code> and the other is titled <code>test.csv</code>.</p>
<p><code>Train.csv</code> will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù.</p>
<p>The <code>test.csv</code> dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù for each passenger. It‚Äôs your job to predict these outcomes.</p>
<p>Using the patterns you find in the <code>train.csv</code> data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in <code>test.csv</code>) survived.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data">‚ÄúData‚Äù tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you‚Äôve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.</p>
<h2>How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle</h2>
<p>Once you‚Äôre ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the ‚ÄúSubmit Predictions‚Äù button<br>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png" width="699" alt=""></li>
<li>Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You‚Äôre able to submit 10 submissions a day.<br>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png" width="699" alt=""></li>
</ol>
<h2>Submission File Format:</h2>
<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond <code>PassengerId</code> and <code>Survived</code>) or rows.</p>
<p>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PassengerId</code> (sorted in any order)</li>
<li><code>Survived</code> (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Got it! I‚Äôm ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?</h2>
<ul>
<li>For Competition Help: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion">Titanic Discussion Forum</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Kaggle doesn‚Äôt have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you‚Äôll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>
<h2>A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks</h2>
<p>As we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.</p>
<p>In every competition, you‚Äôll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It‚Äôs an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition‚Äôs Notebooks <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks">here</a>.</p>

<p>Getting Started competitions were created by Kaggle data scientists for people who have little to no machine learning background. They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>
<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle‚Äôs platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>
<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>
<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team">Team</a> page.</p>
<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion">discussion forum</a>.</p>
<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>
<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a target="&quot;_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview">Courses</a>!</p>
<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>
<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>
<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>
<p><i>"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240">here</a>.</p>
<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>
<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you‚Äôll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you‚Äôll want to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>
<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can‚Äôt find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>
